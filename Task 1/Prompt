Q: You are selecting a database for a new application. You have the following requirements:

Social platform with millions of users

Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users

High data read speed required

Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations

Scalability is important as the user base grows

A: Letâ€™s think step by step.

User scale and data structure:

Millions of users indicate a need for a database that scales well horizontally.

The data includes user profiles (structured), posts (semi-structured or unstructured), and user connections (graph-like relationships).

Read-heavy workload (80% reads):

Read optimization is important. This rules out some databases that are more write-optimized.

Caching may be used, but the base database must support fast read performance.

Connections between users:

This is a strong indicator for needing graph capabilities (e.g., friends, followers, likes).

Traditional relational databases can handle this, but not as efficiently at scale.

Scalability:

A distributed database architecture is preferred, such as NoSQL databases or graph databases that support sharding and partitioning.

Putting it all together:

For profiles and posts: a document-based NoSQL database like MongoDB could work well due to flexible schema and horizontal scalability.

For user connections: a graph database like Neo4j or Amazon Neptune would be optimal for querying relationships quickly.
